# BFS-SMILES
An alternative notation for describing molecules. Wheras SMILES is [DFS-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system#Graph-based_definition), this is BFS-based.

This idea was inspired by [GraphAF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09382), (which in turn is inspired by [MolecularRNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13372)). Another alternative approach to a molecular graph language for deep learning is called [DeepSMILES](https://depth-first.com/articles/2019/03/19/chemical-line-notations-for-deep-learning-deepsmiles-and-beyond/).
